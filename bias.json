Named after 19th-century German psychologists Ernst Heinrich Weber and Gustav Theodor Fechner, it states that the change needed to notice a difference (just noticeable difference or JND) is a constant ratio of the original stimulus. This means larger stimuli need bigger changes to be noticed, while smaller stimuli need smaller changes to be noticed.",
